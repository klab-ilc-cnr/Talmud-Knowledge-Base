# Talmud-Knowledge-Base
The Talmud Knowledge Base (TKB) is an onto-terminological resource designed to integrate the terminology of the Babylonian Talmud with an ontology that describes its content using formal knowledge representation languages. At the moment, it presents a formalization of concepts related to the Temple of Jerusalem, which are structured through classes and properties at the ontological level and denoted by Italian and Hebrew terms representing their lexicalizations, also organized within computational terminologies. While this resource holds intrinsic value, it also provides scholars with an additional computational tool for linguistic-semantic and conceptual access to the text of the Talmud.
